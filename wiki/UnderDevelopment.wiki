== Binary optimization ==
The latest revision of pso on the development branch "psodiscrete" is able to solve binary problems. The fitness function needs to be set up to accept vectors (or matrices, if {{{options.Vectorized}}} has been set to {{{'on'}}}) of 0s and 1s as the input variable. The field {{{options.PopulationType}}} needs to be set to {{{'bitstring'}}} in order to enable this feature.

=== To do before release ===
  * Constraints are to be ignored for now: set up PSO to warn the user if {{{options.PopulationType}}} has been set to {{{'bitstring'}}} and constraints have been provided.
  * Linear constraints might actually be applicable to PSO, and solvable using {{{options.ConstrBoundary}}} set to {{{'soft'}}} with little if any modification to the existing code, set up to handle double vectors. But this needs to be further investigated before allowing pso to do its thing on linearly constrained binary problems. For one thing, we'd still need to check whether it's necessary to force the Constraint Boundary behavior to be {{{'soft'}}}.
